# TyTM (Typora Theme Manager)

A theme package manager for Typora. It's currently in progress, lacking features and not that user friendly.

Current features:
- [x] add a theme
- [x] remove a theme
- [ ] list installed themes

Usage:
```bash
./tytm.exe update
./tytm.exe add <THEME_ID>
```
<THEME_ID> will be theme's name but use lowercase and use dash to replace whitespace. Ex: "GitHub Night" has id "github-night"
```bash
./tytm.exe rm <THEME_ID>
```
