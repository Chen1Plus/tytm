# Themes

Each theme has its own ID and includes one or more sub-themes. To install the default sub-themes, simply use `./tytm add <ID>`.  
If you prefer to install a specific sub-theme, use the `--sub` flag. The `--no-default` flag allows you to add a theme without its default sub-themes.

Below are themes that can be installed by TyTM.
